## Solves the knapsack problem using genetic algorithms.

## Requirements:
    Python>=3.6
    numpy==1.26.2

## How to run:
    Open Command Prompt
```bash
                                    git clone https://github.com/bassammmmm/solving-knapsack-using-genetic-algorithms.git
                                        cd solving-knapsack-using-genetic-algorithms

    Create env (Optional but recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    
    Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies
    ```bash
    env\Scripts\Activate #For windows
    source env/bin/activate #For linux

    python knapsack.py

## How to insert values/weights of the items
    1) Write your values seperated by a space into a the first box
    2) Write your weights seperated by a space into a the second box
    3) Write your knapsack max weight in the third box

    Then it should shows you the best solution/value for 0-1 and unbounded problem.
